[Edit in Codeflow ⚡️](https://stackblitz.com/~/github.com/chrisdennett/pong-paddles)

## TODO

- Make a test area
- Get ball bouncing off paddles
- Adjust simulation so paddles behave a bit more randomly / naturally
- have the simulated paddles hit the ball with different parst of the paddle.  This may happen naturally if they are slowed down.
- have the simlated players winning and losing points.
- add the middle line
- get the serve starting from the middle line and going slowler than usual until hit for the first time.
