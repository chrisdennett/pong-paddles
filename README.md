[Edit in Codeflow ⚡️](https://stackblitz.com/~/github.com/chrisdennett/pong-paddles)

## TODO

- move all params to a central state object.
- stop the jerky motion
- add sounds
- Adjust simulation so paddles behave a bit more randomly / naturally
- have the simulated paddles hit the ball with different parst of the paddle. This may happen naturally if they are slowed down.
- have the simlated players winning and losing points.
- get the serve starting from the middle line and going slowler than usual until hit for the first time.

## ideas

- create a matrix version where everything is made from green text on black
- have a rally tally
- change paddle colour on hit
- shake play area on hit
- try moving middle barrier
- change bat size if score - smaller if score point, larger if lose point
