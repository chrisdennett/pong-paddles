# pong-paddles

[Edit in Codeflow ⚡️](https://stackblitz.com/~/github.com/chrisdennett/pong-paddles)

## TODO

- have the simulated paddles hit the ball with different parts of the paddle. This may happen naturally if they are slowed down.
- add sounds

## ideas

- create a matrix version where everything is made from green text on black
- have a rally tally
- change paddle colour on hit
- shake play area on hit
- try moving middle barrier
- change bat size if you score a point - smaller if score point, larger if lose point
